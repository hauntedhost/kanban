Summary
-------
Kanban is a work-in-progress Trello clone I developed for a final project at [App Academy](http://appacademy.io), a 9-week Ruby on Rails and JavaScript web development intensive in San Francisco.

Built with Ruby on Rails on the backend as a JSON API for Backbone.js on the frontend.

Notes
-----
* Hand-rolled Rails user authentication with BCrypt
* Custom, nested Rails JSON templating with [Rabl](https://github.com/nesquena/rabl)
* Backbone models/collections with [Backbone-relational.js](http://backbonerelational.org/)
* Auto-updating comment timestamps with jQuery [timeago](http://timeago.yarp.com)
* Editable board, list and card titles with jQuery [JEditable](http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable)
